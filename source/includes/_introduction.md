## Rules

### Ratelimits

Each endpoint is ratelimited, the rate of each endpoint is indicated in this documentation. 

There is also a global ratelimit of 60 requests/minute. The global limit is common to all endpoints. 

It is your responsibility to not overstep these limits. Repeated offenses will result in a ban.
