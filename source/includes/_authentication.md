# Authentication

ExoDeus uses API keys to allow you to access the API. In order to obtain an API key, you must first register an account with an email address (`/register`). Once you have submitted the required information in the correct format, you will have to verify the autenticity of your email address(`/verify`).

Once your account is verified, you may request an API Key (`/api-key`) using your credentials. This endpoint can also be used to regenerate your API Key. Note that this will invalidate your previous API Key.

In (almost) all further calls to the API, you will need to include your API Key.

## Register

```json
